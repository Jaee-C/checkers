## Installation and Setup Instructions
Clone this repository. You will need a C compiler such as [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/) or [clang](https://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html) to run the program.

Installation / Compilation:

`make`

To run the program:

`./main`

## How to play the game

Once you start the game, you will be prompted to choose a color, type `black`/`b` or `white`/`w` to choose your color. Black starts first!

Next, you will have to choose a level between 1 and 5 for your game. Now, you can start playing your game!

To make a move, you have to input `<source_cell>-<target_cell>`. This input is **case-sensitive** and in all **upper case**, and the game will stop immediately if you make an invalid input or an imvalid move.

### Game-rules
1. Each player plays all pieces of the same color. Black open the game by making a move, then white make a move, and then players alternate their turns. In a single turn, the player either makes a move or capture.
2. A piece may *move* to an empty cell diagonally forward (toward the opponent; north for black and south for white) one square.
3. When a piece reaches the furthest row (the top row for black and the bottom row for white), it becomes a *tower* (a pile of pieces). A tower may move to an empty cell diagonally, both forward and backward, one square.
4. To *capture* a piece or a tower of the opponent, a piece or a tower of the player jumps over it and lands in a straight diagonal line on the other side. This landing cell must be empty. When a piece or tower is captured, it is removed from the board. Only one piece or tower may be captured in a single jump, and, in this variant of the game, only one jump is allowed in a single turn. 
5. A player wins the game if it is the opponentâ€™s turn and they cannot take action, move or capture, either because no their pieces and towers are left on the board or because no legal move or capture is possible.

## Motivations
This was created as an extension to my UniMelb COMP10002 project to apply the algorithms and data structures I've learnt into a programming project. The main algorithm used for the game bot is the `minimax` algorithm, and it's implemented using a `tree` data structure.
